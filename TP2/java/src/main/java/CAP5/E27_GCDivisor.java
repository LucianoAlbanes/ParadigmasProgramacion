/*
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers is the largest
integer that evenly divides each of the two numbers. Write a method gcd that returns the greatest
common divisor of two integers. [Hint: You might want to use Euclidâ€™s algorithm. You can find
information about it at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm.] Incorporate the method
into an application that reads two values from the user and displays the result.
